We are using Paul Ekmans perception of emotions for modelling this ontology.

Classes:

Emotions are defined as the parent class with basic emotions as a subclass.
The 6 Ekman's basic emotions are defines as individuals that belong to the sub-class Basic Emotions.
All the emotions other than Basic emotions are defined as ComplexEmotions.
Basic Emotions and complex emotions are disjoint.

Data Properties:

6 properties(Quotients) are defined. These are used to define an emotion. These properties are for emotions in general. They have a range of 0-100.They are 
1. AngerQuotient
2. DisgustQuotient
3. FearQuotient
4. SadnessQuotient
5. HappinessQuotient
6. SurpriseQuotient

Individuals:

All the basic emotions are defined with the corresponding emotion quotient as 100 and rest as 0. All the basic emotions are considered as different individuals, exclusive of one another.
