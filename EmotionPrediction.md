Brainstorm:

The idea is to collect the adjectives, adverbs, verbs, Interjections in the given text. All of these parts of speech are tagged with one/more of the basic emotions prior. We add up the score of the each emotion and use this data to determine the dominant emotion/emotional distribution(emotional footprint) of the text/song.

Sub problems:
1) Procuring the dictionary of adjectives/adverbs/verbs/Interjections
2) Tagging each of them with the basic emotions.
3) Test on various data samples from songs, emails, tweets, novel passages etc.,
4) Furthur improvement 

Prob 1&2:

Using twitter and hashtags of the basic emotions happy,anger,fear,disgust,surprise,sadness and their variations(?) and pos tagging for the procurement of the dictionary. And we use the hashtags used as the tags to the words.
